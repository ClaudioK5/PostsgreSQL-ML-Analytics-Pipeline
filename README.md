# PostsgreSQL-ML-Analytics-Pipeline
This pipeline **integrates with the FastAPI PostgreSQL client-orders handler pipeline**, analyzes the orders stored in the database and creates a demand statistics graph, a prediction demand graph using machine learning models, and finally a combined graph. All of the plots are then uploaded on a desired AWS bucket in a graphs folder.
